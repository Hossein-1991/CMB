Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies is one of the pioneering research fields in the cosmology. These anisotropies which stem from small temprature variations are so small. This means that, the Universe was almost homogeneous when the microwave background formed. 
Suppose the measured tempreature of microve background in a given directions is T(&phi; , &theta;)
